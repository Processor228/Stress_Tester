# Stress_Tester

This repository contains a backend for competitive programming 
stress-testing platform. 

What exactly is stress testing in CP? Let me explain...

Suppose you have a solution to some problem A that you are very sure of (a bruteforce, for instance). And you have a solution B for that problem that (maybe more optimal) you are not sure of. So, you 
may wanna run some tests to figure out, whether their output coincide and, more importantly,
differ. This application (with some good UI) may come in handy for such problems.
